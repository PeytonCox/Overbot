# Overbot
This is currently a WIP Overwatch Discord Bot project. However, even though it is a WIP any uploaded code should be functional if someone, for some reason, wanted to use it.

## Install 
- Run Setup_Win.bat if on Windows
- Until I create a script for linux/Mac, use these:
- Put a bot "Token" in a file (in the same directory) named "token.txt"
- Install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install overwatch-api
pip install discord
```
